# Football Betting System

Football betting application

## Problems Addressed

### Problem 1
Football bettors would like to be able to make own prediction in- dependent from predictions of other tipsters.

When betting on football, there is always a temptation to base your betting decision on a opinion of someone else or use a prediction software. However, ex- perts can be wrong or not even following their own forecasts. It can also be quite confusing, which particular expert’s prediction to follow; and after all, opinions of different experts will probably contradict. As already mentioned above, thoughtful football bettors prefer to create their own betting “system” gathering all the im- portant facts about the future game and the participating teams (possibly, just us- ing a notepad and a pen). My application would do this for the user. It would gath- er all the information required for making a good quality betting decision. User would be also able to decide on how much a particular “block” of information (I call it “input variable”) would contribute to the overall result, having the power to influence the output.

### Problem 2
Football bettors rarely monitor their betting results.

The users of my application would be able to create their own betting system being able to change the input variables and influence the weighing percentage for each of them. Those settings will prove wrong or right overtime. The application would generate a performance feedback for every user. In my opinion, looking back and analysing the past performance is the key to become successful in online betting, as well as in any other activity.

### Problem 3
Players bet based on impulse and gamble over their budget.

As part of the responsible gambling strategy, the application would support a feature of setting a weekly gambling limit, possibly as a gentle reminder that the user is gambling too much.
